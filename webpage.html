                    but Scott is plagued by Ramona's elusive past and her "7 evil exes" led by the mysterious "Gideon", all of whom challenge him in succession for the right to date her.

                    <p>Ramona Victoria "Rammy" Flowers is a 24-year-old American expatriate from New York, a "ninja delivery girl" for Amazon and Scott's main love interest.
                        She reveals very little and is very guarded about her past in New York City before she moved to Toronto. 
                        She is capable of traveling through subspace and has seven evil exes who challenge Scott for her affection. 
                        She changes her hairstyle every three weeks and becomes anxious when Gideon is mentioned or brought up.

                    <p>Wallace Wells is Scott's "cool gay roommate". He is 25 years old and first met Scott in college.
                        Wallace is more intelligent, responsible and mature than Scott: 
                        he holds down a job and pays for most of their expenses while they lived together as roommates. 
                        Most of their apartment's furniture and possessions belong to Wallace and he buys the majority of their groceries.

                        Scott dates her for a short while, but breaks up with her after he meets Ramona (though he initially "forgets" to break up with her).
                        Initially a quiet, typical schoolgirl, after their break-up, she cuts and dyes her hair and changes her clothing style, hoping to win Scott back by becoming more of a hipster.

                        Stephen is in a tumultuous relationship with Julie Powers, who at one point suspects that he and Knives may have a mutual attraction to one another.

                    <p>Neil "Young Neil" Nordegraf is Sex Bob-Omb's biggest fan. He briefly dates Knives Chau, until she breaks up with him.
                        He is the quietest character and is very apathetic to almost everything.

                        eventually taking over Scott's band and dumping him. She later reappears, introduced in the series as the lead singer and keyboardist for the popular emerging band
                        "The Clash At Demonhead".
                        Scott describes her original personality as being "nice" and does not understand what she has since become.
